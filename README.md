# superstore_sales_python_dashboard

The Superstore dataset is a rich and comprehensive dataset containing information on the sales, orders, and customers of a fictional superstore. The dataset provides a detailed view of the business operations of the superstore, including information on the products sold, the customers who purchase them, and the sales performance across different regions and categories. This dataset is a valuable resource for data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of retail sales and customer behavior. With about 9,994 rows of data spanning four years (2014-2017), the Superstore dataset provides a wealth of information to analyze and explore.

In this report, I perform python-based exploratory data analysis to gain insights about the fictional superstore.

This python dashboard provides insights on:

* What is the total sales and profit of the superstore?
* What is the total sales and profit by category?
* Show the top 5 states that made the highest sales 
* Show the bottom 5 states that made the highest sales 
* What is the total sales by region and category?
* What is the most popular ship mode class?
* Calculate the average profit by region
